1 NOTE Prince Charles, born in 1948, Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the 
2 CONC throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He 
2 CONC is the son of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Philip Mountbatten, d
2 CONC uke of Edinburgh. Charles's full name is Charles Philip Arthur George. 
2 CONC His titles, in addition to Prince of Wales, are duke of Cornwall; duke 
2 CONC of Rothesay; earl of Carrick; and Baron Renfrew, lord of the Isles and 
2 CONC great steward of Scotland.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Breaking with the tradition of educating royal children at home, his pa
2 CONC rents enrolled Prince Charles in private schools in England and Scotlan
2 CONC d. He attended the Cheam School in Berkshire as a boarder from the age 
2 CONC of 9 to 14 and the school his father attended, Gordonstoun, in Scotland
2 CONC  from age 14 to 18. He has described his school years as unhappy and se
2 CONC ems to have been especially ill-suited for the rugged and spartan condi
2 CONC tions at Gordonstoun, the school chosen by the Duke of Edinburgh to tou
2 CONC ghen up his son. After Gordonstoun, Charles entered Trinity College at 
2 CONC the University of Cambridge, where he studied archaeology, anthropology
2 CONC , and history. Charles became the first heir to the British crown to ea
2 CONC rn a university degree when he graduated with honours from Cambridge Un
2 CONC iversity in June 1970. That year he also assumed his seat in the House 
2 CONC of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament. At the age of 20
2 CONC , in 1969, he was formally invested as the Prince of Wales, a title he 
2 CONC had been given in 1958. Charles served in the Royal Air Force and the R
2 CONC oyal Navy from 1971 to 1977.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Although he has travelled widely as a representative of the crown, Char
2 CONC les has been viewed as a man with little to do while waiting to succeed
2 CONC  to the throne. As one solution he founded the Princes Trust, an organi
2 CONC zation established to provide opportunities for young people through tr
2 CONC aining, education, and financial support. As its president he has remai
2 CONC ned closely involved with the trust. Charles is also involved with some
2 CONC  200 other charitable organizations that reflect his wide range of inte
2 CONC rests, from architecture to alternative medicine and conservation.Y

1 NOTE Elizabeth II, born in 1926, queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britai
2 CONC n and Northern Ireland. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born in London, th
2 CONC e first child of the duke and duchess of York, later King George VI and
2 CONC  Queen Elizabeth. Her sister, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The 
2 CONC two princesses were educated at home by a Scottish governess.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After her father succeeded to the throne in 1936, Princess Elizabeth, a
2 CONC s heiress presumptive, began studies in constitutional history and law 
2 CONC to prepare for her future position as queen. As she became older, Eliza
2 CONC beth began to take part in public life. She was 14 years old when she m
2 CONC ade her first radio broadcast, a speech to the children of the Commonwe
2 CONC alth of Nations in October 1940. When she was 16 she carried out her fi
2 CONC rst public engagement, an inspection of the Grenadier Guards in April 1
2 CONC 942.
2 CONT 
2 CONT During World War II (1939-1945) Elizabeth and her younger sister were s
2 CONC ent for safety from Buckingham Palace in London to live first at Balmor
2 CONC al, Scotland, and later at the royal lodge at Windsor, England. Althoug
2 CONC h her father did not want Elizabeth to be called up for national servic
2 CONC e during the war, she herself was most eager to join the Auxiliary Terr
2 CONC itorial Service, the women's branch of the British Army. She was finall
2 CONC y allowed to join in March 1945.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On November 20, 1947, Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten, the former 
2 CONC Prince Philip of Greece, at Westminster Abbey in London. He had become 
2 CONC a British subject nine months earlier and was married under the title o
2 CONC f Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh. A year later Elizabeth gave birth t
2 CONC o a son, Charles. In 1950 she gave birth to a daughter, Anne. A second

1 NOTE Edward VII (1841-1910), king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
2 CONC  Ireland and emperor of India (1901-1910). The Edwardian period is name
2 CONC d after him. Edward was born on November 9, 1841, in Buckingham Palace,
2 CONC  London, the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and was ch
2 CONC ristened Albert Edward. He studied at the universities of Edinburgh, Ox
2 CONC ford, and Cambridge.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1860 he visited Canada, inaugurating the custom of goodwill visits b
2 CONC y members of the British royal family, particularly the Prince of Wales
2 CONC , to British dominions and foreign countries. In 1863 Edward married Al
2 CONC exandra, eldest daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. The prince an
2 CONC d princess then assumed much of the burden of court ceremonials and pub
2 CONC lic functions, which Queen Victoria had laid aside on going into virtua
2 CONC l retirement after the death of the prince consort in 1861. Edward trav
2 CONC elled extensively. In Russia and France, particularly, he made valuable
2 CONC  personal contacts in political and social circles.
2 CONT 
2 CONT At home, his popularity was increased both as Prince of Wales and as ki
2 CONC ng by his interest in sports, notably yachting and horse racing; his ho
2 CONC rses won the Derby in 1896, 1900, and 1909 and the Grand National at Li
2 CONC verpool in 1900. Edward succeeded to the throne in 1901. From the begin
2 CONC ning of his reign he adopted a policy of promoting international amity 
2 CONC in Europe, where political tension had been mounting. His visits to var
2 CONC ious European capitals from 1901 to 1904 and return visits to him by Eu
2 CONC ropean rulers helped promote the signing of arbitration treaties in 190
2 CONC 3-1904 between Britain and France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Portugal.
2 CONC  He was also an important force behind two agreements that strengthened
2 CONC  the position of Britain on the Continent, the Entente Cordiale of 1904
2 CONC  between France and Britain, and a pact between Russia and Britain in 1
2 CONC 907.  In 1909 the king and queen paid a diplomatic visit to Emperor Wil
2 CONC liam II of Germany (Edwards's nephew) that temporarily dispelled German
2 CONC  suspicion that the increasingly friendly relations between Britain and
2 CONC  France and Russia were aimed at weakening Germany. Because of his effo
2 CONC rts to increase international amity the king became known as Edward the
2 CONC  Peacemaker.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward died at Buckingham Palace on May 6, 1910, having reigned for onl
2 CONC y nine years. Three daughters and two sons were born of the marriage be
2 CONC tween Edward and Alexandra. The sons were Prince Albert Victor, duke of
2 CONC  Clarence, and George, duke of York, who succeeded Edward as George V. 
2 CONC In 1896 Edwards youngest daughter, Princess Maude Charlotte Mary Victor
2 CONC ia, married her cousin, Prince Charles of Denmark, who later became Kin
2 CONC g Hkon VII of Norway.Y

2 CONC  the rank of vice admiral in 1903.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The death in 1892 of his elder brother, Albert Victor, duke of Clarence
2 CONC , made George second in line to the succession. He married his brother'

2 CONC  college at Osborne; the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth; and Magdalen C
2 CONC ollege, University of Oxford.
2 CONT 
2 CONT During World War I he served with the Grenadier Guards in France, Italy
2 CONC , Flanders, and Egypt. In 1919 he undertook the first of many official 
2 CONC goodwill tours to Canada and other countries. In the 1920s and 1930s he
2 CONC  supported slum-clearance projects, aid to the unemployed, and improvem
2 CONC ent of the working conditions of British miners.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the death of his father, King George V, in January 1936, Edward was 
2 CONC proclaimed King Edward VIII. Before long, rumours circulated about his 
2 CONC alleged romance with an American, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson, then ma
2 CONC rried to her second husband, a London shipping broker. On October 20, 1
2 CONC 936, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin counselled Edward, as king and head
2 CONC  of the Church of England, to remove all cause for the rumours. A week 
2 CONC later Mrs. Simpson was granted a divorce, to become final in six months
2 CONC . In November the king confided to Baldwin that he intended to marry Mr
2 CONC s. Simpson even if it meant his abdication. A morganatic marriage was p
2 CONC roposed, but the cabinet was unwilling to accept this compromise. On De
2 CONC cember 11, 1936, therefore, the king abdicated in favour of his brother
2 CONC , the duke of York, who became King George VI. Edward received the titl
2 CONC e duke of Windsor and married Mrs. Simpson in June 1937. Because his wi
2 CONC fe was not accorded the privileges of a royal duchess in England, the d
2 CONC uke of Windsor resided abroad.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1937 he observed social and housing conditions in Germany and visite
2 CONC d Adolf Hitler. During World War II he served as a major general in the
2 CONC  British Expeditionary Force, and he was governor of the Bahamas from 1
2 CONC 940 to 1945. After the war he lived as a private British citizen, chief
2 CONC ly in the United States and France. At the funeral of George VI in Febr
2 CONC uary 1952, he took part in a British royal ceremony for the first time 
2 CONC since his abdication. The duke wrote A King's Story (1951) which was ma

1 NOTE Princess Diana (1961-1997), Princess of Wales from 1981 to 1997. Diana 
2 CONC was born Diana Frances Spencer in Sandringham, Norfolk, England. Her fa
2 CONC ther, Edward Spencer, was heir to an earldom, and her mother was the da
2 CONC ughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy. Diana was educated at Riddlesworth Hall
2 CONC , a preparatory school in Norfolk, and later at the West Heath School i
2 CONC n Kent. She attended finishing school in Switzerland at Chateaux d'Oex 
2 CONC at Montreux. From 1979 until 1981 Diana worked as a kindergarten teache
2 CONC r at the exclusive Young England School in Pimlico, London.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On February 24, 1981, her engagement to Prince Charles, son of Queen El
2 CONC izabeth II and the heir to the British throne were announced. They were
2 CONC  married in Saint Paulâs Cathedral in an internationally televised ce
2 CONC remony on July 29, 1981, with an audience numbering in the hundreds of 
2 CONC millions. Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry an heir to the Brit
2 CONC ish throne in more than 300 years. The couple had two sons: Prince Will
2 CONC iam Arthur Philip Lou is (born June 21, 1982) and Prince Henry Charles 
2 CONC Albert David (popularly called Harry, born September 15, 1984).
2 CONT 
2 CONT By the late 1980s, strains in the royal couple's marriage had been wide
2 CONC ly publicized, and in December 1992 a separation was announced. By that
2 CONC  time Diana had adopted charity work as her royal duty. In 1993 she bri
2 CONC efly withdrew from public activities in an effort to avoid the negative
2 CONC  publicity focused on her separation from Prince Charles. Formal divorc
2 CONC e proceedings began in early 1996, and in August 1996 Diana and Charles
2 CONC  were legally divorced. After the divorce it was agreed that Diana woul
2 CONC d be known as Lady Diana, Princess of Wales, and would no longer be per
2 CONC mitted to use the title Her Royal Highness. The couple had joint custod
2 CONC y of their children.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Diana actively supported many charities related to homeless and deprive
2 CONC d children, drug abuse, breast cancer, and victims of acquired immunode
2 CONC ficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 1987 Diana sat with a man dying from AIDS 
2 CONC and shook his hand, a gesture credited with promoting acceptance and co
2 CONC mpassion for people with the disease. She was the vice president of the
2 CONC  British Red Cross and served as a member of the International Red Cros
2 CONC s advisory board. In 1997 Diana visited Angola and Bosnia and Herzegovi
